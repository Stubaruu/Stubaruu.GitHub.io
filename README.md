This portfolio is the result of a term long project that was assigned in my CS160 class. To construct it, I used a template provided by w3Schools. I added my own HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make it unique. I utilized GitKraken to push what changes I made to my Github repository, and used their service to host it.
The Data visualization was the second part to this project. It is a visualization of data provided by Zagster Bike Share Service. I imported data from a herokuapp service and imported it into the graphs using JavaScript. 

 This portfolio will continue to evolve as my skillset improves, and I add more and more projects to showcase.
